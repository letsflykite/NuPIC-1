    INTRODUCTION:
    This is a proof of concept for the 2013 NuPIC Hackathon written by Ryan Elisei in less than 24 hours
    
    This application is an approximation of what driving traffic incident mapping and prediction would look like using the Bing Maps API
    The Traffic API details are available here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh441725.aspx
    The original goal was to predict latitude and logitude, which can be done, but due to time constraints at the hackathon, the scope was
    reduced to only predicting the latitude of an accident.
    
    The data used in FakeTrafficData.csv is an approximation of output of what data may looking like when retrieved and put into a useful
    format from the Bing Maps Traffic API. It contains hard-coded trends, such as accidents near down-town at 2am, and a higher
    concentration of incidents during the morning commute along the common commuting routes. Also note that the grid of incident
    occurences in east Seattle were simple a default area for non-peak traffic hour low severity traffic incidents. Again, this data
    was only for demonstration purposes and not what would be found in the API.
    Also, the prediction steps used were for the next 1 step and the next 5 steps, so you will notice that the first few rows of the
    traffic data do not contains predictions at the end of the data columns.
    It is possibleto use different techniques to predict both lattitude and longitude, but thsoe approaches were also cut due to
    time constraints. Predictions were made via NuPIC.
    
    Further improvements would aim to produce a new route based on where accidents are predicted to occur along the default route. This
    would make the route directions highly time sensitive, and not useful beyond the time scale when the predictions were made.
